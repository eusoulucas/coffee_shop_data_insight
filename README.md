# Data ETL Using Polars
### Datacamp Exercise
#### This is a mocktest for a Datacamp Certification

Polars is a new library that aims to dethrone Pandas.

I redone this code that was made in Pandas and changed to Polars.

This repository contains notebooks and data for a data analysis project. The data folder contains the datasets used for the analysis.

The notebooks in this repository serve different purposes:

## *etl.ipynb*
- Notebook contains code for extracting, transforming, and loading data from different sources into a format suitable for analysis.
## *analysis.ipynb* 
- Notebook contains the main analysis code. It uses Pandas and other data analysis libraries to explore the datasets, visualize the data, and draw insights from it.
## *outlier.ipynb* 
- Notebook contains code for identifying and handling outliers in the data.

Feel free to explore the notebooks and datasets in this repository to learn more about the data analysis project.
